# ðŸŽ® Guardians Game

ðŸŽ® Guardians Game is a game I make to practice and learn some frontend skills.
The goal of this project is to link it with Twitch API, and be able to buy items and characters with channel points.

I might add some attack / defense mode in the future, but this is not the main focus atm.

Stack :

- React
- TypeScript
- **Vite.js**
- **SCSS**
- **Redux** (WiP)
- **REST API** (WiP)
- Testing Library ? Jest ? (I did not decided yet)

**Bold** : Skills I'm focusing on for this project (+ Git, + React Suspsense)

## Documentation :

I'll write some documentation after Core Commit.
